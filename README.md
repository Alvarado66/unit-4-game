## Can You Match The Numbers?
  In this game, you will be given a number at random from
  the start. Your job is to figure out what the value is 
  for each of the four crystals (also a random value) and 
  make the sum equal to the number given.
  
  ### The creation
  
    During the creating of the game, it was challenging and 
    much so rewarding when you accomplish the goals in mind.
    
    Writing the code to create a random number and also a random 
    number to assign each crystal was quite the mystery but 
    quickly became more like a pattern and what to do with said numbers
    after the player matches the target number that will display
    their "Wins" or "Losses."
